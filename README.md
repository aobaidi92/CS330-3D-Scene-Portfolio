# CS330 – 3D Scene Portfolio Artifact  
**CS 330 Computational Graphics and Visualization – Final 3D Scene Portfolio Submission**

This repository contains my final 3D scene project for CS 330. It includes the complete ZIP file for the full project, the Design Decisions document, and my written reflection required for Module Eight. This work demonstrates my ability to design, develop, and implement a fully realized 3D scene using OpenGL, transformations, lighting, and custom object construction.

# Project Overview  
This 3D scene was built from the ground up using modern OpenGL fundamentals. The project includes fully modeled objects, custom transformations, multiple lighting types (ambient, diffuse, and specular), textures, materials, and a freely navigable camera. It reflects careful planning, structured code design, and iterative development across several milestones.

# Module Eight Reflection  
Below are my answers to all Module Eight reflection prompts.

## **1. How do I approach designing software?**

Throughout this project, I learned the importance of beginning with a clear design plan before writing any code. I used sketches and rough layout ideas to determine where objects would go, how the camera would move, and how lighting should interact with the scene. This planning step helped prevent confusion later and made the coding process smoother.

### **What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?**  
I developed a stronger sense of modular design. Breaking the scene into components—such as `SceneManager`, `ViewManager`, object classes, shaders, and materials—helped keep the project organized. I also improved in designing objects from geometric primitives and planning transformation hierarchies.

### **What design process did you follow for your project work?**  
My design process was iterative. I first built simple placeholder objects, then refined their shapes, added materials, added lighting, then adjusted positioning and scale. Each milestone layered new features and required reviewing earlier design choices to keep everything consistent and functional.

### **How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**  
Planning early, breaking code into modules, sketching components, and iterating frequently are strategies I can use in any software project—especially in game development, visualization, UI design, and even backend systems.

## **2. How do I approach developing programs?**

My development process for this scene focused heavily on incremental progress and constant testing. I only added one feature at a time—such as textures, lighting, materials, or new object models—then verified it before moving to the next step.

### **What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?**  
I relied on debugging visuals (like wireframe mode), console output, and parameter tweaking to understand rendering issues. I also improved my ability to structure shader code and manage OpenGL state in a clean, predictable way.

### **How did iteration factor into your development?**  
Iteration was essential. Very few features worked correctly on the first attempt. Lighting required multiple adjustments to normals and material properties. Camera movement required tuning. Object alignment needed trial and error. Iterating quickly allowed the project to improve in visual quality and stability.

### **How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?**  
By the end, my code became more organized, my debugging became more efficient, and my comfort with OpenGL and 3D math significantly improved. I moved from “make it work” to “make it structured,” which is a major development step for me as a programmer.

## **3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**

Computer science gives me the foundation to build real-world systems, games, simulations, websites, and interactive applications. This project helped reinforce my ability to reason about complex systems and break them down into manageable pieces.

### **How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?**  
This project deepened my understanding of transformations, normals, lighting calculations, shader programming, and 3D math. These concepts carry over into game engines, simulations, AR/VR work, and advanced graphics courses.

### **How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?**  
The ability to understand graphics pipelines, design 3D objects, and manage complex real-time rendering processes is valuable in roles such as software engineering, graphics development, UX/UI work, simulation programming, and visualization engineering. Employers look for problem-solving ability and technical depth—this project strengthened both.
